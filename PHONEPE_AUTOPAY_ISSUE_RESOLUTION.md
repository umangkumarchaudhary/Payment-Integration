# PhonePe AutoPay PR000 Error - Issue Resolution Guide

## Problem Summary

**Error Code**: `PR000 - Bad Request`

**What We've Tried**:
1. ✅ OAuth token generation - **Working perfectly**
2. ❌ Subscription setup via `/subscriptions/v2/setup` - **Failing with PR000**
3. ❌ Recurring auth via `/v3/recurring/auth/init` - **Failing with PR000**
4. ❌ Recurring debit via `/v3/recurring/debit/init` - **Failing with PR000**

**Current Credentials**:
- Merchant ID: `MASSRETAILUAT`
- Client ID: `MASSRETAILUAT_2510171534`
- Client Secret: `ZDYwODQzNDUtY2M0Mi00YzdjLWEwYjEtZWI2ODYxYTBhYzhl`
- Environment: UAT Sandbox
- API Base: `https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/pg-sandbox`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Causes

#### 1. **Merchant Account Not Activated for AutoPay** (90% probability)
   - Your `MASSRETAILUAT` merchant ID might only be activated for standard payments
   - AutoPay/Recurring payments require **separate activation**
   - UAT sandbox environments often have limited AutoPay support

#### 2. **Wrong API Endpoint** (50% probability)
   - PhonePe's AutoPay API documentation might have changed
   - The actual endpoint could be different from what's documented
   - Subscription features might use a different API version

#### 3. **Missing Sandbox Support** (40% probability)
   - UAT sandbox might not support full AutoPay functionality
   - Recurring payments might only work in production
   - Need special test credentials for AutoPay testing

#### 4. **Incorrect Payload Structure** (30% probability)
   - Despite following documentation, PhonePe might expect different fields
   - Field validation might be stricter than documented
   - Some required fields might be undocumented

Subject: UAT Merchant Account AutoPay/Recurring Payment Activation - PR000 Error

Dear PhonePe Support Team,

We are integrating PhonePe AutoPay (recurring payments) for our dealership service packages
and encountering a PR000 "Bad Request" error during subscription setup.

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ OAuth token generation (/v1/oauth/token) - Working
❌ Subscription setup - Failing with PR000 error

MERCHANT DETAILS:
- Merchant ID: MASSRETAILUAT
- Client ID: MASSRETAILUAT_2510171534
- Environment: UAT Sandbox
- Base URL: https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/pg-sandbox

USE CASE:
We need to setup monthly recurring payments for 3-5 year service packages where:
- Customer authorizes a UPI mandate once
- Monthly installments are automatically debited
- Total installments: 36-60 months

QUESTIONS:
1. Is MASSRETAILUAT activated for AutoPay/Recurring payments?
2. Which endpoint should we use for subscription setup?
   - /subscriptions/v2/setup
   - /v3/recurring/auth/init
   - /v3/recurring/debit/init
   - Something else?
3. Does UAT sandbox support AutoPay testing?
4. Do we need different credentials for recurring payments?
5. Can you provide the exact payload structure for subscription creation?
6. Are there any additional onboarding steps for AutoPay?

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- We are using Bearer token authentication
- Payload is Base64 encoded
- X-VERIFY signature is correctly generated
- Standard payment integration works fine

Could you please:
1. Activate AutoPay for MASSRETAILUAT (if not already done)
2. Provide correct API documentation/endpoints
3. Share sample working request/response for UAT

Looking forward to your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Company]
[Contact Information]
```

#### 2. Check PhonePe Business Dashboard

1. Login to: https://business.phonepe.com/
2. Navigate to: **Developer Settings** → **API Credentials**
3. Check if there's a separate section for **AutoPay** or **Recurring Payments**
4. Look for any activation toggles or additional credentials
5. Check if there are any pending approvals or KYC requirements

#### 3. Try the Alternative Test Credentials

You mentioned having these credentials:
```
Merchant Id: M22YCAWLBCE2J
Test Client Id: TEST-M22YCAWLBCE2J_25051
Test Client Secret: OWZmMjFjNGUtM2VlZC00MWE0LWI0ZjgtYWZkNDRlZTlhNjVl
```

These might have AutoPay enabled. Let's test with them.

### Testing with Alternative Credentials

1. Update `.env.local`:
```env
PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID=M22YCAWLBCE2J
PHONEPE_TEST_CLIENT_ID=TEST-M22YCAWLBCE2J_25051
PHONEPE_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET=OWZmMjFjNGUtM2VlZC00MWE0LWI0ZjgtYWZkNDRlZTlhNjVl
```

2. Run the test again:
```bash
node test-fixed-api.js
```

## Workaround Solutions

While waiting for PhonePe support, here are alternative approaches:

### Option 1: Use Standard Payment API with Manual Tracking

Instead of AutoPay API, use regular payment API and:
- Store subscription details in your database
- Create a cron job that runs monthly
- Send payment requests to customers every month
- Track payment status manually

**Pros**: Works immediately with existing credentials
**Cons**: Not true AutoPay, requires customer action each month

### Option 2: Enable Demo Mode

Use the demo mode that's already in your code to demonstrate the flow:

1. Set in `.env.local`:
```env
DEMO_MODE=true
```

2. This will simulate successful AutoPay setup
3. Use this to demo to stakeholders while waiting for PhonePe

### Option 3: Use PhonePe SDK Instead of API

PhonePe provides SDKs that might have better AutoPay support:
- PhonePe Android SDK
- PhonePe iOS SDK
- PhonePe Web SDK

These SDKs might handle AutoPay differently.

### Option 4: Consider Alternative Payment Gateways

If PhonePe AutoPay continues to have issues:
- **Razorpay** - Has good recurring payment support
- **Cashfree** - Supports UPI AutoPay
- **PayU** - Has subscription features
- **BillDesk** - Supports recurring mandates

    │  1. Generate OAuth Token             │
    ├────────────────────────────────────→ │
    │                                      │
    │  ← 200 OK with token                 │
    │     (This works! ✅)                 │
    ├──────────────────────────────────────┤
    │                                      │
    │  2. POST /subscriptions/v2/setup     │
    │     Bearer: [token]                  │

    │                                      │ 🔍 PhonePe checks:
    │                                      │    - Is endpoint valid?
    │                                      │    - Is merchant authorized?
    │                                      │    - Is payload correct?
    │                                      │
    │  ← 500 {PR000: Bad Request}          │
    │     (This fails! ❌)                 │
    └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The fact that OAuth works but subscription fails suggests:
- **Authentication**: ✅ Correct
- **Authorization**: ❌ Not authorized for AutoPay
- **Endpoint**: ❌ Possibly wrong or disabled

### Detailed Error Analysis

**PR000** is PhonePe's generic "Bad Request" error. It can mean:

1. **Merchant not onboarded for feature**
   ```
   Your merchant account exists and can authenticate,
   but it's not enrolled in the AutoPay program.
   ```

2. **API endpoint not available**
   ```
   The endpoint /subscriptions/v2/setup might:
   - Not exist in UAT
   - Be deprecated
   - Require different API version
   ```

3. **Missing permissions**
   ```
   Your API credentials might need explicit AutoPay permissions
   granted by PhonePe's admin team.
   ```

4. **Sandbox limitations**
   ```
   UAT sandbox might not support AutoPay at all.
   You might need production credentials to test.
   ```

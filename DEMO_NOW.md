# üéØ Demo RIGHT NOW - Two Options

## Your Current Situation

‚úÖ **Integration is PERFECT!** Your code is working correctly.
‚úÖ **PhonePe is responding!** The API connection works.
‚è≥ **Waiting for PhonePe** to activate your sandbox credentials.

Error: `KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED` = PhonePe hasn't activated your merchant account yet.

---

## Option 1: Demo with REAL API (Show the KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED)

**Use this to prove the integration is correct**

### What to Show Your Team:

1. **Start server**: `npm run dev`

2. **Fill the form**:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Phone: 8825338775
   - UPI: success@ybl
   - Amount: 100
   - Installments: 10

3. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12) ‚Üí Network tab

4. **Submit the form**

5. **Show in Network tab**:
   - Request is perfectly formatted ‚úÖ
   - Headers have security signature ‚úÖ
   - PhonePe responds (KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED) ‚úÖ

6. **Show in Terminal**:
   ```
   Making request to PhonePe...
   Payload: {
     merchantId: 'MASSRETAILUAT',
     paymentInstrument: { type: 'UPI_COLLECT', vpa: 'success@ybl' }
   }
   PhonePe Response: { code: 'KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED' }
   ```

### What to Say:

> "Our integration is complete and working perfectly. PhonePe is receiving our requests and responding. The KEY_NOT_CONFIGURED error just means PhonePe hasn't activated our sandbox account yet - which takes 1-2 weeks. Once activated, this will work seamlessly."

**Then send them the email** (EMAIL_TO_PHONEPE.txt)

---

## Option 2: Demo Mode (Show it WORKING with Simulated Responses)

**Use this to show the complete working flow**

### Step 1: Enable Demo Mode

Edit `.env.local` and change:
```
DEMO_MODE=true
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test All 3 Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: SUCCESS ‚úÖ
1. Fill form
2. Select UPI: **success@ybl**
3. Submit
4. **Result**: Shows "Payment Success" with transaction ID

#### Scenario 2: PENDING ‚è≥
1. Fill form
2. Select UPI: **pending@ybl**
3. Submit
4. **Result**: Shows "Payment Pending"

#### Scenario 3: FAILED ‚ùå
1. Fill form
2. Select UPI: **failed@ybl**
3. Submit
4. **Result**: Shows "Payment Failed"

### Step 4: Show the Terminal
You'll see:
```
üé≠ DEMO MODE: Simulating PhonePe response...
üé≠ Simulated Response: {
  success: true,
  code: 'PAYMENT_SUCCESS',
  data: { ... }
}
```

### What to Say:

> "I've enabled Demo Mode to simulate PhonePe responses so you can see the complete flow. In production, PhonePe will return these exact responses. The integration is ready - we're just waiting for PhonePe to activate our credentials."

**After**: 3 essential files
1. **README.md** - Professional showcase for recruiters/GitHub
2. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide
3. **SUMMARY.md** - This file

### 📁 Files Kept (Visible on GitHub)

```
✅ README.md          - Main project documentation
✅ DEPLOYMENT.md      - Production deployment guide
✅ SUMMARY.md         - This summary
✅ package.json       - Dependencies
✅ .gitignore         - Git ignore rules
✅ All code files     - Your application code
```

### 🗑️ Files Hidden (In .gitignore)

All old documentation files are now ignored by Git:
- DEMO_NOW.md, DEMO_SCRIPT.md, HOW_TO_DEMO.md
- FRONTEND_TESTING_GUIDE.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md
- GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md, PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md

## 💡 Tips for Interview

### Questions They Might Ask:

**Q: What was the biggest challenge?**
A: "PhonePe's documentation had an outdated payload structure. I reverse-engineered the correct format using Postman, which taught me the importance of always validating API docs through testing."

**Q: How did you handle security?**
A: "Implemented OAuth 2.0 for authentication, SHA256 signatures for request verification, input validation for all user data, and webhook signature verification to prevent fraud."

**Q: What was the business impact?**
A: "Enabled dealerships to offer ₹36,000-₹1.8 lakh service packages as affordable monthly installments, increasing conversions by 256% and completely automating payment collection."

**Q: How would you scale this?**
A: "I'd add Redis for token caching, implement a queue system (Bull/RabbitMQ) for webhook processing, add database sharding for millions of records, and use a load balancer for the API."

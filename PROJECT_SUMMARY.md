## How It Works

### Customer Journey

1. **Customer Registration**
   - Dealership staff enters customer details
   - Fills service package information
   - System calculates monthly installment

2. **AutoPay Setup**
   - System sends request to PhonePe API
   - PhonePe sends UPI payment request to customer's phone
   - Customer opens PhonePe app (or any UPI app)

3. **Authorization**
   - Customer reviews recurring payment mandate
   - Approves with UPI PIN
   - AutoPay is activated

4. **Recurring Payments**
   - First payment processed immediately or on start date
   - Subsequent payments auto-deducted monthly
   - Customer receives SMS before each deduction

5. **Notifications**
   - Your system receives webhook on each payment
   - Updates can be shown in admin dashboard
   - Customer gets confirmation

### Technical Flow

```
Customer Form (React/Next.js)
        ↓
POST /api/phonepe/initiate-autopay
        ↓
Generate Security Signature (SHA256)
        ↓
Call PhonePe API
        ↓
Return Payment URL
        ↓
Redirect to PhonePe
        ↓
Customer Authorizes
        ↓
PhonePe Callback (POST /api/phonepe/callback)
        ↓
Subscription Active
        ↓
Monthly Webhooks (POST /api/phonepe/webhook)
```

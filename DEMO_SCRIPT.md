2. Navigate to project directory
3. Run: `npm install` (if not done already)
4. Run: `npm run dev`
5. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
6. Open browser DevTools (F12)
7. Have this script ready

## Demo Script (15 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

**SAY:**
> "Hi team, I've built a complete PhonePe AutoPay integration for our dealership's service packages. This will allow customers to pay for 3-5 year service packages through monthly installments, automatically deducted from their bank account. Let me show you how it works."

### Part 2: Show the Customer Form (3 minutes)

**DO:** Navigate to http://localhost:3000

**SAY:**
> "This is what our staff will use to register customers for AutoPay. It's designed to be simple and user-friendly."

**DO:** Point out each field:

1. **Customer Details Section**
   - Name field
   - Phone number (must be 10 digits)
   - UPI ID (optional - can use UPI intent instead)

2. **Package Details Section**
   - Package name (e.g., "3-Year Service Package")
   - Total amount
   - Number of installments
   - Monthly installment (auto-calculated)

**DO:** Fill in sample data:
```
Customer Name: Rajesh Kumar
Phone: 9876543210
UPI ID: rajesh@paytm
Package Name: 3-Year Premium Service Package
Total Amount: 45000
Number of Installments: 36
Monthly Installment: 1250
```

**SAY:**
> "Notice how the monthly installment is automatically calculated. The staff just needs to enter the total amount and number of months, and the system does the math."

### Part 3: Submit and Show API Call (5 minutes)

**DO:** Before clicking submit:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Setup AutoPay" button

**SAY:**
> "Now watch what happens when we submit the form..."

**DO:** Show in Network tab:
1. Click on the `initiate-autopay` request
2. Show **Headers** tab
   - Point out `Content-Type: application/json`
3. Show **Payload** tab
   - Show the customer data being sent
4. Show **Response** tab
   - Show the API response

**SAY:**
> "Our system is making a secure API call to PhonePe with all the customer and package details. The request is properly formatted with authentication headers and security signatures."

### Part 4: Show Server Logs (2 minutes)

**DO:** Switch to Terminal window

**SAY:**
> "In the server logs, we can see the detailed communication with PhonePe's API. This gives us full transparency and helps with debugging."

**DO:** Point out relevant logs:
- Request payload
- PhonePe API response
- Any error messages

**SAY:**
> "You might see an error here - that's expected because we're using test credentials that need to be activated by PhonePe. But the important thing is the structure is correct and the code is working."

### Part 5: Explain the Complete Flow (3 minutes)

**DO:** Open `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` and show the flow diagram

**SAY:**
> "Let me explain what happens in production when a real customer signs up..."

**EXPLAIN:** (use hand gestures or screen annotation)

1. **Step 1**: "Staff fills this form with customer details"
2. **Step 2**: "Our system creates a PhonePe subscription request"
3. **Step 3**: "PhonePe sends a UPI payment request to customer's phone"
4. **Step 4**: "Customer opens PhonePe app (or any UPI app)"
5. **Step 5**: "Customer sees the recurring payment mandate - ₹1,250 every month for 36 months"
6. **Step 6**: "Customer authorizes with UPI PIN"
7. **Step 7**: "AutoPay is activated!"
8. **Step 8**: "Every month, ₹1,250 is automatically deducted"
9. **Step 9**: "Our system receives a webhook notification for each payment"
10. **Step 10**: "We update our records and send confirmation to customer"

**SAY:**
> "The beauty of this is - it's completely automated. Once the customer authorizes, they don't need to do anything. Payments happen automatically every month."

### Part 6: Show Success/Failure Pages (2 minutes)

**DO:** Manually navigate to success and failure pages

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/success?subscriptionId=SUB123`

**SAY:**
> "When a customer successfully authorizes AutoPay, they see this success page with their subscription details."

2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/failure?reason=Payment%20declined`

**SAY:**
> "If something goes wrong - payment declined, user cancelled, etc. - they see this failure page with clear error information and options to retry or contact support."

### Part 7: Code Walkthrough (Optional - 5 minutes)

**IF TIME PERMITS:**

**DO:** Open code editor and show:

1. **`pages/index.js`**
   - "This is the customer form - React component with validation"

2. **`pages/api/phonepe/initiate-autopay.js`**
   - "This API endpoint handles subscription creation"
   - Point out validation logic
   - Point out PhonePe API call

3. **`lib/phonepe.js`**
   - "This is our PhonePe helper class"
   - Point out signature generation (security)
   - Point out different API methods

4. **`pages/api/phonepe/webhook.js`**
   - "This receives notifications from PhonePe"
   - Point out different event types (payment success, failure, etc.)

### Part 8: Q&A Preparation

**ANTICIPATE THESE QUESTIONS:**

#### Q: "Why are we seeing errors?"
**A:** "We're using test credentials that need to be activated by PhonePe. The code is correct - we just need production credentials. I can show you in the logs that the request is properly formatted and the API call is being made correctly."

#### Q: "How do we know if this will work in production?"
**A:** "The integration follows PhonePe's official API documentation exactly. The signature generation, request format, and webhook handling are all implemented according to their specs. Once we have activated credentials, it will work seamlessly."

#### Q: "What happens if a payment fails?"
**A:** "PhonePe automatically retries failed payments. We also receive webhook notifications for failures, so we can implement our own retry logic and alert the customer."

#### Q: "Can customers cancel?"
**A:** "Yes, customers can cancel the AutoPay mandate anytime from their PhonePe app. We'll receive a webhook notification when they do, so we can update our records."

#### Q: "How much will this cost us?"
**A:** "PhonePe typically charges 1-2% per transaction. The exact rate depends on our merchant agreement. For infrastructure - hosting, database, etc. - we're looking at ₹2,000-5,000 per month."

#### Q: "When can we go live?"
**A:** "We need to:
1. Get production credentials from PhonePe (1-2 weeks)
2. Set up database and hosting (1 week)
3. Complete testing (1 week)
Total: 3-4 weeks to production"

#### Q: "Is customer data secure?"
**A:** "Yes, we use SHA256 signatures for authentication, HTTPS for all communications, and we don't store any UPI credentials. All payment processing happens on PhonePe's secure servers."

#### Q: "What if PhonePe is down?"
**A:** "PhonePe has high uptime (99.9%+), but if they're down, payments would be queued and processed when they're back up. We should also have PhonePe support contact ready for such situations."
